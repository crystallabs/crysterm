  # `.run`), the registry of devices (`#screens`) and surfaces (`#windows`),
  # whole-app shutdown, the app-wide "active window", and the clipboard facade.
  #
  # No singleton is enforced: multiple `Application`s may coexist (via
  # `Mixin::Instances`). `Application.global` returns the most-recently-created
  # one — "the current app" — creating one on demand. This mirrors
  # `QGuiApplication`'s role without forcing a hard singleton.
