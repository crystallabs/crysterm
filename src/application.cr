  # The application — the `QGuiApplication` analogue of the Qt object model (see
  # QT-OBJECT-MODEL-PLAN.md). It owns the event loop (`#exec` / `.exec_all` /
  # `.run`), the registry of devices (`#screens`) and surfaces (`#windows`),
  # whole-app shutdown, the app-wide "active window", and the clipboard facade.
  #
  # No singleton is enforced: multiple `Application`s may coexist (via
  # `Mixin::Instances`). `Application.global` returns the most-recently-created
  # one — "the current app" — creating one on demand. This mirrors
  # `QGuiApplication`'s role without forcing a hard singleton.

    # `Window#destroy`, which calls `#remove`.
    #
    # This is deliberately **not** the same registry as the class-level
    # `Window.instances`: that one tracks *every* surface ever created — including
    # one never attached to an `Application` (a `Window.new` enters the alternate
    # buffer in its constructor, before any `#exec`/`#listen`) — and is what
    # `at_exit` walks to restore every terminal on shutdown. The two serve
    # distinct purposes (global teardown net vs. per-app routing view), so both
    # are kept rather than collapsed into one.
