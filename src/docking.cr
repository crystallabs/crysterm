  # Reusable "docking" component.
  #
  # Docking takes the points where line-drawing characters cross or meet
  # (e.g. two box borders touching, or `Widget::Line`s crossing) and replaces
  # the overlapping/adjacent characters with a single character that joins them
  # seamlessly. For example, these border-overlapped elements:
  #
  #     ┌─────────┌─────────┐
  #     │ box1    │ box2    │
  #     └─────────└─────────┘
  #
  # become:
  #
  #     ┌─────────┬─────────┐
  #     │ box1    │ box2    │
  #     └─────────┴─────────┘
  #
  # The component is intentionally agnostic about *what* produced the
  # characters. It operates purely on the in-memory grid of cells (`lines`),
  # so the same logic serves borders, `Line` widgets, and anything else that
  # draws with the box-drawing characters in `ANGLES`.
  #
  # Callers collect the set of rows ("stops") on which line-drawing characters
  # were emitted (only rows with *horizontal* segments need to be collected;
  # vertical segments are picked up when a horizontal stop crosses them), then
  # call `dock` to re-evaluate every relevant cell on those rows. See
  # `Screen#_dock` and `Widget#register_dock_stops` for the callers.
