    # A vertical menu of `Action`s.
    #
    # The (visible) actions are shown as selectable rows; arrow keys (and, with
    # `vi: true`, `j`/`k`) navigate, and Enter — or a click on the highlighted
    # row — activates the selected action. Activating emits the action's
    # `Event::Triggered`, received by any listener attached via
    # `action.on(Crysterm::Event::Triggered) { ... }`. Disabled actions are
    # listed but not activated.
    #
    # In Qt, `QMenu : public QWidget` — a menu is a plain widget, **not** a
    # `QAbstractItemView` (which `CSS::Qss` maps to `List`). So `Menu` derives
    # `Box` and only *includes* `Mixin::ItemView` for item rows/navigation,
    # rather than inheriting `List`. Its CSS identity is `Menu < Box < Widget`,
    # matching Qt's hierarchy: a theme's item-view rules (`QAbstractItemView {
    # background-color; … }`) don't bleed onto menus, so it takes the
    # `QMenu`/window surface like other `QWidget`-derived chrome
    # (`QMenuBar`/`QStatusBar`). (`Tree`/`ListTable`/the combo `Popup` are real
    # `QAbstractItemView`s.)
