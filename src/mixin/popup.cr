module Crysterm
  module Mixin
    # Shared lifecycle for a widget that owns a floating pop-up *child* shown next
    # to it — a drop-down list, a calendar, … (`Widget::ComboBox`,
    # `Widget::DateEdit`). It centralizes the open flag, showing/raising/focusing
    # the pop-up, the modal input grab, the outside-click watcher that dismisses
    # it, the grab region, and teardown.
    #
    # The including widget:
    #   * defines `#popup_widget : Widget?` — its current pop-up (or `nil`);
    #   * defines `#close` — the dismiss path; the outside-click watcher calls it,
    #     and it should call `#teardown_popup` then do any widget-specific cleanup
    #     (e.g. refocusing itself);
    #   * builds and positions the pop-up, then calls `#show_popup`;
    #   * calls `#teardown_popup_on_destroy` from its own `#destroy`.
    #
    # (`Widget::Menu` deliberately does *not* use this: it is its own pop-up, with
    # a submenu chain rather than a single child, so it manages its own lifecycle.)
