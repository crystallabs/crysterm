module Crysterm
  # An independent, window-sized cell buffer with a z-order — the unit a widget
  # (and its subtree) renders into once promoted to a *layer* (via CSS
  # `z-index`, or `style.z_index`). After the base buffer is painted by the
  # normal painter, each plane is composited over it bottom-to-top, honoring
  # the per-cell `Attr::Alpha` modes and the plane's own `opacity`. This is
  # what lets an "opaque" overlay show other widgets' content through it.
  #
  # Planes are opt-in: a UI with no z-index allocates none and the render path
  # is unchanged.

    # so an untouched cell contributes nothing. A widget's render overwrites
