# Source Code

In the code, questions and/or things to verify at some later point are identified with "XXX".

Things to change/improve are identified with "TODO".

# List of TODOs

All XXX and TODO items in the sources.

Currently events are emitted whereever needed with just e.g.: `emit SomeEvent, ...`.
See if this is OK, or if events to emit should be passed via a channel and always be emitted from a single/same Fiber.

Examine effect of `use_buffer` variable in Tput, and see whether it can be completely removed, or it can be used
meaningfully in some way?

There is a concept of Unicode and "full Unicode". Full being the one with all Unicode stuff that Crystal currently 
does not support outside of its UTF-8 support. See what to do this over time - is there a chance Crystal would
support more, or the idea of "full Unicode" needs to be just dropped from the sources.
